/**
 * Map an agent phase to a human-readable status label for the heartbeat line.
 * Returns null for phases that should not override the current status.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: every phase emitted by loop.ts via onPhaseChange must be handled
 * here or explicitly documented as intentionally ignored. Currently handled:
 * - heartbeat (loop.ts heartbeat timer)
 * - intent-veto (loop.ts intent evaluation)
 * - preparing (loop.ts pre-stream chain)
 * - working (loop.ts stream start)
 * - tool-hint (loop.ts tool call hint)
 * - stop-reason (loop.ts / turn-orchestrator — why the turn loop ended)
 * - convergence-warning (loop.ts L2 kick — the escalation rung BEFORE the
 *   convergence abort; must be user-visible or the eventual熔断 looks like it
 *   came out of nowhere: session 8396ac51 got 10 silent nudges then a hard stop)
 * - body-guard (turn-orchestrator — the outgoing body hit the transport-size guard:
 *   historical tool outputs were truncated for this request, or the body is close to
 *   the limit. Either way the model's view differs from what the user believes, and a
 *   near-limit body 400s outright on relays with smaller caps.)
 * - image-stripped (turn-orchestrator — a 413 / image rejection made the client
 *   drop image_url parts from the request. The model answering that turn never
 *   saw the images; without a visible line the user reads it as "the model
 *   ignored my screenshot". See issue #94.)
